                    <div class="project-text">I started with a wireframe in Balsamiq and created the sections separately. This was a more challenging site to create as there are many design styles that are more complicated but it is a good test for my coding knowledge. Through the process I  had a stronger understanding of CSS and was able to create and use this as a foundation for future projects.

                    <div class="project-text">The design was created to appeal to the more feminine customers as most of the flowers are normally given to females. Pink and other lighter tones were chosen to accentuate the flower and natural feeling of the site. Use of space and layout was chosen to give the visitors a clear understanding of which section they are in. Both the typography, colors, and design were chosen to create a relaxed and boutique feeling.
