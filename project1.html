                    <div class="project-text">The idea came when we were taking a look at the various movie review sites that are currently available on the internet and we found that either they are hard to find and navigate or there is just too much going to find what we are looking for. We decided as a team of three to create a movie review site that is easy to use and a pleasurable experience to browse. The movie review sites features trailers of currently playing movies with a page for visitors to sign up and register.

                    <div class="project-text">We brainstormed various ideas on how the movie site will look like and what content will be included. To bring the ideas to life, we modeled the design in Balsamiq to create wireframes that will give us a general idea of how the site will look and where elements will be placed. Then we went ahead and created a mockup in Photoshop. The mockup has colors and design added in which give us a realistic representation of the site. During the development process, we used Git to work together as a team.

The idea was to create a portal where visitors can see the latest trailers and information about the movie in a cinema-like experience, which is the reason we called the project CineCafe. I used a black and white theme with a grid layout to show each individual movie. To add to the experience, a full screen movie trailer was created for the landing page.
