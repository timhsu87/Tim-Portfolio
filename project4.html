                    <div class="project-text">A website is always a good platform to increase the visibility of any organization and to let people know what your organization is about. Our church currently does not have a website and I thought it would be a good idea to create one to show to them and maybe in the future they will think to use a website as a form of communication channel. I was looking to design a website that will be easy to use and navigate and allow visitors to enjoy spending time on the website to learn more about our church.

                    <div class="project-text">I browsed through a few church websites and noted to myself which ones have designs that will be similar to what I have in mind. I drew out a wireframe in Balsamiq and immediately started coding and modified my design along the way. The harder part was to figure out what content is important to be placed on the website and in what section. I wanted to make the homepage aesthetically pleasing so I added the animated hero images.

                    <div class="project-text">For the church website, I used a clean design layout to make it easier for first time visitors to find the necessary information they are looking for such as meeting times and location. The call to action button is placed right in the center with a blue background to accentuate and increase the visibility. I went with the hero image with transitions to add to the overall appeal of the site to attract the visitors.
